			<h3>Why we are here</h3>
			<p>
				Students and staff at the University of Washington often run into the issue of being unable to find a quiet place to study.
				Our goal is to bring together these people with quality study spaces.
				Be it simply a quiet place, a room with classmates, or a hangout spot with friends, our focus is to save time by figuring out how busy places are, so you don't have to.

			<h3>Who is using it?</h3>
			<p>
				It could be that student at the back of the class that always seems to ace mid-terms.

				In any situation, that could be YOU joining that group and breezing through assignments and tests.
				Students, staff, and faculty at the University of Washington all have access to this invaluable resource, so start using it today!

			<h3>What we provide</h3>
